     <h2> STYLE GUIDE </h2>
      <p>
      For my final style guide I returned to the color palette that is commonly seen in food applications and food itself. These colors are red, yellow, and green. I went to my local grocery store and took photos of the produce. Afterwards I placed them into an online color generator for palette inspirations. Second page of the guide is the image of tomatoes that inspired my direction for the rest of the branding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ingredient Endeavors style guide includes a cover page, photo for color direction, a color palette with primary and secondary colors, fonts for logotypes and body, as well as logotypes in two colorways.

    <h2> INFOGRAPHIC </h2>
    <p>
      This infographic is based on data I had collected during my journey in 73 weeks of meal planning. It represents the of the number of cuisines repeated over that time in number and percentages. They are separated into two categories, mains and sides. <p>
    <p>After completing the infographic I wanted to comment about my findings and provide additional notes. These can be found under the "OUTCOME" section. There is an explanation that I had not included every recipe that I had made during that time, but only ones that I could clearly identify under specific cuisines. Also, I mention the limitations I had on ingredients and how that may have influenced the results. I found it to be quite enlightening!

       <h2> PROTOTYPE </h2>
       <p> The goal of my final prototype is to demonstrate the task flow of user's journey. The user searches their desired ingredient, finds an inspiring recipe that includes the ingredient and creates a grocery list based off of their selections. 
       </p>

       <h2> THE USER JOURNEY </h2>
       <p>The frames below are labeled left to right for the task direction. Below each frame are descriptions of the user's actions as well as how the Ingredient Endeavors application responds to them. </p>

        <h2> ILLUSTRATIONS </h2>
       <p>
     Illustrations are very prominent throughout my prototype due to my background in illustration. I wanted to include them to demonstrate my ability to bring my background of illustration together with both my academic and professional experiences and to demonstrate those disciplines.
     <p>
      I first focused on creating artwork that features the recipes in "Eggs in Purgatory". The recipe is very simple, those ingredients include herbs and tomatoes. I also created an additional illustration of the final meal, a skillet with tomatoes and eggs. Additionally are supplemental illustrations of food items.

  <p> My process includes both digital and physical tools to complete my project. I have a strong background in illustration that I have complimented with digital edits.

    <h2 class="processtitle"> Personas</h2>
    <p> The purpose of Ingredient Endeavors is to make meal planning and preperation easier. For that reason, my personas are a very wide variety for any life stage or life style. The app is meant for anything who is wanting to explore cooking and perhaps streamline their planning capabilities by the ability to search by ingredient and narrow through cuisine types.</p>

     <h2 class="processtitle"> Illustration Process</h2>
     <p>
      My illustrations started with very loose sketches that I then transferred to watercolor paper. The style that I chose is based off of what I very much enjoyed in the past, studio classes! They are meant to look gesturely and like sketches. The style is a twist on the very loose watercolor look that I use in my professional work.

     <h2 class="processtitle"> Wireframe Sketches</h2>
     <p>
       Coming out of my experience with cuisines, cooking, prep, and through all of the data I gathered, I wanted to make this accessible and fun for a novice or an experienced cook to see what ingredients are available and what can stem from those in assisting with their ingredients. This is where the process started for the prototype.

       <h2 class="processtitle">Prototype of Wireframes</h2>
       <p>
        Moving forward with my findings from the sketches and user feedback on my prototype I created wireframes in Adobe Xd. I cleaned them up to be much more simplified so that they would be easier for a user to process and complete their task.

        <h2 class="processtitle">Branding Phase 1</h2>
        <p>
         Here is my initial exploration in branding for Ingredient Endeavors. I explored color palettes that are not traditional to food applications. Colors that are typical are red, green, and yellow. I also explored different text layouts for a logotype. At this time I wanted to explore the layout and had not yet gone into different font options.

        My research and the data that I had collected is largely based off of my culinary journey and documentations that I had completed during that time. These documentations include 73 weeks of meal planning Monday through Sunday each week, cookbook word documents, as well as over 500 photographs of my dishes as well as those at restaurants. Many of my photographs serve as a visual of the journey. Photos that especially do are the ones where I took them step by step. For example, when I made pumpkin pasta from scratch! I baked the sugar pumpkins to make puree, then I made the dough, rolled it out, put it through my Kitchen Aid attachement and then finally shaped the pasta. My culinary journey has been an exciting process. During those weeks I made nearly 300 new recipes. From it I gained valuable lessons in planning and cooking that I hope to share with others through this project.

         The images to the right are photos that I took of meals that I had made at home. I love taking photos of food and am very inspired by restaurants and their artful plating styles. Though I own several different plate sets I am no where near blogger level with it. I do aspire to be as creative as the professionals with my own dishes!

        At the bottom of my data and research list I note existing projects. I had completed those projects during this program. They are very similar to my Capstone in theme, food. This project also stems off of what I took away from them. One specifically worth mentioning was a prototype I created during my UX class. It was meal delivery prototype that taught me a lot with the process of user testing and reworking for a better user experience.

    <p class="r_description">
      In the goal to share what I had learned to others through my documentation over those 73 weeks, I wanted to create an infographic. This infographic is based off of the different cuisines that I had repeated during that time. </p>
      <p class="r_description">Each "x" represents one meal. I also divided the data between "MAINS" and "SIDES".

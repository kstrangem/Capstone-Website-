        My research and the data that I had collected is largely based off of my culinary journey and documentations that I had completed during that time. These documentations included 73 weeks of meal planning Monday through Sunday each week, cookbook word documents as well as over 500 photographs. Many of these photographs serve as a visual of the process. Especially the ones where I took step by step photos, such as making pumpkin pasta from scratch! I baked the sugar pumpkins to make puree, then made the dough, rolled it out and then shaped the pasta. My culinary journey has been an exciting process. During those weeks I made nearly 300 new recipes. All of it has taught me valuable lessons in planning and cooking that I hope to share with others through this project.

         The images to the right are photos that I took of meals that I had made at home. I love taking photos of food and am very inspired by restaurants and their artful plating styles. Though I own several different plate sets I am no where near blogger level with it. Though, I do aspire to be as creative as the professionals with my own dishes!
       <p class="r_description">
        At the bottom of my data and research list I mention previously existing projects. This project also stems off of what I took away from similar projects that I had completed in this program. One in particular was a meal delivery prototype for my UX class.

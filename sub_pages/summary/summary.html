      <p>
        I am excited at the beginnings of this project and have hopes that it may develop into something more since I plan to continue to share what I have learned with others.
        To me, this project reflects on all of my education as a whole. It combines my background in illustration as well as design both in my professional career and education. I am very proud of it and looking forward to how this project can grow and what I can do next!</p>

        This project is also largely inspired by existing projects that I had created during the MAGWD program. One of them in particular was a food delivery prototype, similar to Door Dash, that I had made during my UX Design class. I have many takeaways from the process of completing that project, very notable ones are the lessons from user testing and the evolution of my prototype as a result. That is why it was a strong influence in my decision to create another prototype.

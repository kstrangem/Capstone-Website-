      <p>This project has been quite the journey! I feel I have come really far in this program, and it certainly has taught me a lot. To me, this project reflects on all of my education as a whole. My background is illustration, so I have included that. I found motivation in my biggest challenge of learning UX and prototyping, so that is my base for this project. I also tried something that I have never made with an infographic. Overall I think this came together really well, and I am looking forward to what I can do next!</p>

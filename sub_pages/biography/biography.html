      <h2> ABOUT </h2>

      <article>
        <p>
          Ingredient Endeavors is a product of my culinary journey with food, cooking and restaurant inspirations. I did not attempt to cook until I lived on campus during undergrad. It was the best effort I could make to avoid starvation, which included self inflicted food poisoning from dijon chicken. Well, despite some failures there have been many wins. I have come a very long way since then! 
        </p>
        <p>  
          My interest in cooking took off after graduation, starting with Food Network magazines and their online recipes. Over time it turned into an obsession. I seemed to run out of new recipes to try on Food Network. That is when I acquired cookbooks, the collection started, and my meal planning began. In 2015 I recorded meals every day throughout the week for 73 weeks. During that time I tried near 300 new recipes. I also created word documents of my books so I could easily meal plan with them while away from home. These were quite complex recipes and at the start, not at all organized to be budget friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides learning skills such as making pasta from scratch or how to not break bernaise sauce, the journey over those weeks had taught me a lot about budgeting and planning. I learned to pair similar ingredients together to save money and which cuisines work best together. Mexican and Chinese work surprisingly well with each other in a weekly plan! This process and the vast collection of data, which include the recordings and over 500 photos, inspired me to create this meal planning app for Capstone. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Ingredient Endeavors is a prototype for an app that is meant to help make cooking and planning more approachable by having the ability to search recipes by ingredients. This process helps to save money as well as inspire new ideas. The project combines what I have learned during this program. I had prototyped similar food themed apps such as one for food delivery. It also includes my background of illustration with watercolor paintings.
